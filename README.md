## About

This GNOME extension allows you to see your PC's uptime directly from your top task bar. Quite easy and lightweight.

In order to install, be sure you have Tweaks installed like `sudo apt install gnome-tweaks` and create a folder on `$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/kosmicteal+ubuntuptime@kosmicteal.local`, where you need to place the zip content.
